# Hi, I'm Priti 👋

I’m a student passionate about **learning and creating**. I love exploring **engineering skills** while also being interested in **medicine and healthcare innovation**.  

I’ve participated in **climate project competitions** and was honored to receive funding from **GAIN**. I also worked as a **Project Officer** for **Vector-Borne Disease (VBD)** initiatives.  

I enjoy **building projects, solving problems**, and collaborating with others who want to make a positive impact.
